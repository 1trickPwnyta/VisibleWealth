Did you know that your thrumbofur stockpile makes up a massive portion of your colony's wealth? Did you know that your snowhare corpse is worth $18? Well now you can see a detailed breakdown of your colony's wealth, including all your items, buildings, and pawns.

You can visualize your wealth as a list or as a pie chart, each with options to further customize their appearance. Do you want to see all your sources of wealth laid out in order from most to least expensive? You can do that. Do you want to see how much your building wealth counts toward raid points compared to other wealth? You can enable raid point mode.

There are three ways to open the wealth breakdown window. By default, you can click the $ symbol in the bottom right corner of your screen (same area as the roof overlay button etc.) or you can press Shift+4 (like you're typing a $, and this shortcut key can be changed in the settings). In the settings you can also enable a main button that appears at the bottom of your screen near the History tab button.
